## Python environment

The anaconda environment used to run this notebook can be created using [environment.yml](./environment.yml) file by running the below command in the `Assignment_1` folder
```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
```
It is suggested that you use VSCode to run the cells, but they should work using standard jupyter notebook also.

### Note: 
- Do not forget to run the first 2 cells before you run any tasks (`prepare_data()`), it will download all additional point clouds and datasets required for the tasks.
- Recommended to do `Run All` once at beginning
- Press `Esc` to start and exit animations
