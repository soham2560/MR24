    " * Fill in the roll numbers and names of all the teams members in the cell above.\n",
    " * Code must be written in Python in Jupyter Notebooks. We highly recommend using anaconda distribution or at the minimum, virtual environments for this assignment.\n",
    " * All the code and result files should be uploaded in the github classroom.\n",
    " * You can use the in-built methods and **unless explicitly mentioned**, don't need to code from scratch for this assignment. Make sure your code is modular since you will be reusing them for future assignments.\n",
    " * All the representations are expected to be in a right-hand coordinate system. All the functions related to transformation matrices, quaternions, and 3D projection are expected to be coded by you.\n",
    " * You could split the Jupyter Notebook cells where TODO is written, but please try to avoid splitting/changing the structure of other cells.\n",
    " * All the visualization should be done inside the notebook unless specified otherwise.\n",
    " * Plagiarism will lead to heavy penalty."
