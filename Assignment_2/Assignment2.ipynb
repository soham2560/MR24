    "### Instructions\n",
    " * Fill in the roll-number in the cell above.\n",
    " * Code must be submitted in Python in jupyter notebooks. We highly recommend using anaconda/miniconda distribution or at the minimum, virtual environments for this assignment.\n",
    " * All the code and result files should be uploaded in the github classroom.\n",
    " *  Most of the questions require you to **code your own functions** unless there is a need to call in the abilities of the mentioned libraries, such as Visualisation from Open3D. Make sure your code is modular since you will be reusing them for future assignments. All the functions related to transformation matrices, quaternions, and 3D projection are expected to be coded by you.\n",
    " *  All the representations are expected to be in a right-hand coordinate system.\n",
    "<!--  * Answer to the descriptive questions should be answered in your own words. Copy-paste answers will lead to penalty. -->\n",
    " * You could split the Jupyter Notebook cells where TODO is written, but please try to avoid splitting/changing the structure of other cells.\n",
    " * All the visualization should be done inside the notebook unless specified otherwise.\n",
    " * Plagiarism will lead to heavy penalty.\n",
    " * Commit the notebooks in the repo and any other results files under the result folder in the GitHub Classroom repo. \n",
    " * This is a group assignment. Discussions are encouraged but any sharing of code among different teams will be penalized. "
